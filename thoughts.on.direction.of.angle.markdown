for y = x, less than means right, greater than means left. (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), say they gave (8,1). Definitely turned right, and 1 is less than expected value of 8.

for y - -x: (1, -1), (2,-2), (3,-3). Say they gave (5, 0). the direction is left. And 0 is greater than the expected value for straight line, which is -5.

Can you find a case where this is not true? 

x = 3: Say they gave (3,5), (3,7). Then, say they gave (7,2). This is a vertical line. The turn is to the right. 7 could not have been on the original line at all. The line does not go through x = 7 at all. So you revert to comparing x values. We "expect a 3" if the line is to be straight. We got a 7, which is greater than 3. This seems to indicate that this is not the way to do this.

Can you always use the same coordinate??

y = 3: 
x = 3


Here's what I think the scoop is:

1. Pick a coordinate (either x or y) that you are going to compare between the line and the outside point. Always use y unless the slope == 0 (as in y = 3). Use x if slope == 0.
2. Compare point 2 and point 3 (the outside point) for the chosen coordinate. If the outside point is GT, then RIGHT. If EQ, then STRAIGHT. If LT, then LEFT.
3. If your original direction is TOWARDS the origin, then REVERSE the turn direction.
